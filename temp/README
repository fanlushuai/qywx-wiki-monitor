Project LightBulb is a wrapper on top of Facebook's own JS-SDK to simply developing applications using Graph API. You dont need to worry about underlying objects, structures, workflows. Just use it and shout "Light Bulb" :)


To Start testing, create a virtual host in your local machine "lb.appstep.net" and point it to 127.0.0.1

<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName lb.appstep.net
ServerAlias lb.appstep.net
DocumentRoot /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/lb
DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.php index.php4 index.php5
<Directory /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/lb>
Options -Indexes +IncludesNOEXEC +FollowSymLinks
allow from all
AllowOverride All
</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

And point your browser to http://lb.appstep.net/test/
